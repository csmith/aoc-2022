= Advent of Code 2022

This repository contains my solution to 2022's https://adventofcode.com/2022[Advent of Code] puzzles in SQL using Postgres.

The easiest way to run these is using docker â€“ simply execute run.sh <day> to build a docker image and execute the specific day.

I have separate repositories for solutions from previous years:
